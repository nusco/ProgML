## Programming Machine Learning

Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains all the explanations that I couldn't cram in the book.

As of January 2020, I'm still working on the main text of the book, so this site is a work in progress. I'll add articles to it as the book completes its path to the printers. Come back soon!
