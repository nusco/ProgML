## Programming Machine Learning

Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains all the explanations that I couldn't cram in the book.

As of January 2020, I'm still working on the main text of the book, so this site is a work in progress. I'll add articles to it as the book completes its path to the printers. Come back soon!

### Articles

I wrote additional information as a series of Medium posts:

* *Work In Progress:* _Of Gradients and Matrices_ explains how I wrote the code for a multi-dimensional `gradient()` function.
* *Work In Progress: * _The Problem with Accuracy_ tells you why accuracy can be a misleading metric in machine learning, and it gives you a couple of alternatives.
* â€¦
