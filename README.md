Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn).

Here are all the explanations that I couldn't cram in the book as a series of Medium posts. _Some of these are still work in progress, because I started working on this site as I completed the book. Subscribe to my [Medium channel](https://medium.com/@nusco) if you want to be notified when I publish a new one._

* **Work In Progress:** That multi-dimensional `gradient()` function in the _Hyperspace!_ chapter is a tough one-liner. _Of Gradients and Matrices_ explains how I wrote it.
* **Work In Progress:** Accuracy can be a misleading metric in ML. _The Problem with Accuracy_ tells you why, and it gives you a couple of alternatives.
* **Work In Progress:** Grokking the Cross Entropy Loss.
