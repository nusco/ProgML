Hi there from Paolo Perrotta! This site contains a few explanations that were too long to fit in Programming Machine Learning.

Looking for the book itself? Go [here for the eBook](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn/programming-machine-learning) and [here for paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1680506609/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ductyp-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1680506609&linkId=21357a11b4a7bc9be95476540d1d3a09).
