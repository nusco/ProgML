Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to my book [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains links to a few explanations that were too long to fit in the book.

_Update (April 2020): As probably happened to you, the current COVID-19 situation is making my life complicatedâ€“especially so as I live in a heavily hit area in Italy. Be patient if I take longer than I planned to write the articles on this site. A couple are already available below. (Please mail me at paolo.nusco.perrotta@gmail.com if you need to contact me in the meantime.)_
