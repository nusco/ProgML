Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains all the explanations that I couldn't cram in the book.

_If you came here, chances are you followed a link from the book's latest beta. Here's the plan (as of January 16): I just sent the book to production and started working on this site. The book should take a couple of months to get to the printers. During that time, I'll write the missing content and link it from this page. Please come back later! (And mail me at paolo.nusco.perrotta@gmail.com if you need to contact me in the meantime.)_
