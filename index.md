## Additional Material

### Supplemental Articles

These articles contain explanations that I couldn't fit in the book.

* [Of Gradients and Matrices](https://medium.com/@nusco/of-gradients-and-matrices-1b19de65e5cd)
* [The Problem with Accuracy](https://medium.com/@nusco/the-problem-with-accuracy-3670891b908e)
* [Grokking the Cross Entropy Loss](https://medium.com/@nusco/grokking-the-cross-entropy-loss-cda6eb9ec307)
* [Killer Combo: Softmax and Cross Entropy](https://medium.com/@nusco/killer-combo-softmax-and-cross-entropy-5907442f60ba)
* [Neural Networks Visualized](https://nusco.medium.com/neural-networks-visualized-6cc657f9d7c5) (called _The Math of Multiple Layers_ in the book's first printing)

### Canceled Articles

* **_Convolutional Neural Networks in Plain English_**: After some handwringing and a lot of procrastinating, I resolved not to write this article. I'll remove references to it from future printings of the book. I don't feel that the article fits the narrative of the book anymore.
CNNs have become less relevant since I wrote the book, progressively losing ground to [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))-based architectures.
If you came here for a good primer to CNNs, I recommend [this brilliant interactive demo](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).
