Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to my book [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains links to a few explanations that were too long to fit in the book.

* [Of Gradients and Matrices](https://medium.com/@nusco/of-gradients-and-matrices-1b19de65e5cd)
* [The Problem with Accuracy](https://medium.com/@nusco/the-problem-with-accuracy-3670891b908e)
* [Grokking the Cross Entropy Loss](https://medium.com/@nusco/grokking-the-cross-entropy-loss-cda6eb9ec307)
* Coming Soon-ish: _Killer Combo: Softmax and Cross Entropy_
* Coming Sooner: _The Math of Multiple Layers_
* Coming Later: _Convolutional Neural Networks in Plain English_
