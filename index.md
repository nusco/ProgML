Hi there! I'm Paolo Perrotta, and this is the companion site to my book [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/pplearn). It contains links to a few explanations that were too long to fit in the book.

_As of February 2020, I'm still working on filling in this site. If you're looking for an article that isn't here yet, but it's referenced in the book, then please come back later! (And mail me at paolo.nusco.perrotta@gmail.com if you need to contact me in the meantime.)_
